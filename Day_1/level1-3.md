LEVEL 1

Q1: What is Cairo designed for, and what makes its processor unique?

A1: Cairo is a programming language designed for creating zero-knowledge proofs. Its processor is unique because it is "universal" and can efficiently execute any computation. This means that any function that can be computed algorithmically can be executed on the Cairo processor, making it a versatile choice for cryptographic applications.

Q2: How does Cairo's virtual CPU handle cryptographic constraints, and what advantage does this offer?

A2: Cairo's virtual CPU is designed to handle cryptographic constraints by incorporating specific built-in operations that are commonly used in cryptographic computations. These operations are optimized for performance and provide a more efficient way to implement cryptographic algorithms compared to traditional general-purpose processors. The advantage of this approach is that it allows developers to build cryptographic systems with better performance and lower overhead, making it well-suited for applications where efficiency and security are crucial.

LEVEL 2

Q1: What is Starknet, and what technologies does it leverage for scalability, privacy, and security?

A1: Starknet is a Layer-2 scalability solution for the Ethereum blockchain developed by StarkWare. It aims to address the scalability issues of Ethereum by allowing users to perform complex computations off-chain and then submit only the necessary information back to the Ethereum mainnet. Starknet leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and a technology called Validium for scalability, privacy, and security.

Q2: How does Starknet function as a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, and what cryptographic systems does it use to reduce computation costs?

A2: Starknet functions as a Layer-2 scalability solution by allowing users to submit "validity proofs" instead of the entire computation data to the Ethereum mainnet. These validity proofs are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that prove the correctness and validity of the computation without revealing the sensitive data involved. This significantly reduces the computation costs and congestion on the Ethereum mainnet. The cryptographic systems used include STARKs (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), which are a specific type of Zero-Knowledge Proof that provide scalability and efficiency benefits.

LEVEL 3

Q1: What is Starkware, and what has been its key innovations in the blockchain industry?

A1: Starkware is a company focused on developing innovative solutions for scaling blockchains and enhancing their privacy and security. Its key innovations include the development of STARKs (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), a cryptographic proof system that enables efficient and scalable Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and StarkEx, a protocol for off-chain exchange of assets that leverages STARKs to ensure transaction validity.

Q2: How does StarkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain with minimal on-chain footprint?

A2: StarkEx, developed by Starkware, leverages STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain. When users perform trades or transfers off-chain, StarkEx generates STARK proofs that mathematically demonstrate the validity of these transactions without revealing any sensitive information. These proofs are then periodically aggregated and submitted to the Ethereum mainnet, reducing the on-chain footprint to only a few data points. This approach greatly enhances scalability and reduces the transaction costs on the blockchain while maintaining the same level of security and trustworthiness.
